# Lab 02: Use Azure OpenAI SDKs in your App

### Estimated Duration: 120 Minutes

## Lab Overview

In the lab, you will perform the role of a software developer who has been tasked to implement an app that can use generative AI to help provide hiking recommendations. The techniques used in the exercise can be applied to any app that utilizes Azure OpenAI APIs.

With the Azure OpenAI Service, developers can create chatbots, language models, and other applications that excel at understanding natural human language. The Azure OpenAI provides access to pre-trained AI models, as well as a suite of APIs and tools for customizing and fine-tuning these models to meet the specific requirements of your application. In this exercise, you'll learn how to deploy a model in Azure OpenAI and use it in your application.

## Lab Objectives

In this lab, you will complete the following tasks:

- Task 1: Review the Azure OpenAI resource provisioned earlier.
- Task 2: Set up an application in Cloud Shell
- Task 3: Configure your application
- Task 4: Test your application

## Task 1: Review the Azure OpenAI resource provisioned earlier.

In this task, you will review the provisioned Azure OpenAI resource within your Azure subscription. This step is essential to access OpenAI models and retrieve the endpoint and API key required to authenticate your application.

1. In the **Azure portal**, search for **Azure OpenAI (1)** and select **Azure OpenAI (2)** from Services section.

   ![](../media/azoai.png)

1. On the **Microsoft Foundry | Azure OpenAI** page, select **Azure OpenAI (1)**, and then choose **OpenAI-Lab01-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"></inject> (2)**

   ![](../media/sloai.png)

1. To capture the Keys and Endpoints values, on **OpenAI-Lab01-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"></inject>** blade:

      - Expand **Resource Management (1)** and select **Keys and Endpoint (2)**.

      - Copy **Key 1 (3)**, and save it securely in a text editor (e.g., Notepad) for use in later steps.

      - Next, copy the **Endpoint (4)** by clicking the copy icon, and save it in the same location.

1. To save the changes made to the file, right-click on the blank space in the file text editor and hit **Save** or press **Ctrl + S**.

   >**Note:** Make sure to indent the code by eliminating any extra white spaces after pasting it into the code editor.

## Task 4: Test your application

In this task, you will run the application and interact with the Azure OpenAI model using different system and user prompts. This hands-on testing will help you observe how prompt variations affect the model’s output.

1. In the folder of your preferred language, open the **system.txt** file. For each of the interactions, you'll enter the **System message** in this file and save it. Each iteration will pause first for you to change the system message.

1. In the interactive terminal pane, ensure the folder context is the folder for your preferred language. Then, enter the following command to run the application.

    - **C#:** `dotnet run`
    
    - **Python:** `python application.py`

      > **Tip:** You can use the **Maximize panel size** (**^**) icon in the terminal toolbar to see more of the console text.

1. For the first iteration, navigate to `System.txt` **(1)** file and then enter the following message and **Save** the file :

   **System message:** **(2)**
   
   ```
   You are an AI assistant 
   ```

    ![](../media/new/q8.png) 
   
    ![](../media/new/q9.png)

     >**Note:** System message should given in system.txt in C# or Python. Follow the same steps for the remaining prompts.
   
1. In the terminal, press **Enter** a key to continue.

    ![](../media/new/q7.png)

1. In the Enter User message, give the following message.

   **User message:**
   
   ```
   Write an intro for a new wildlife Rescue 
   ```

    ![](../media/wlres.png)

    ![](../media/pyop.png)  

    >**Note:** User message should given in terminal in C# or Python. Follow the same steps for the remaining prompts.

1. Observe the output. The AI model will likely produce a good generic introduction to a wildlife rescue.

1. Next, enter the following prompts, which specify a format for the response:

   **System message:**
   
   ```
   You are an AI assistant helping to write emails
   ```

   **User message:**
   
   ```
   Write a promotional email for a new wildlife rescue, including the following:-Rescue name is Contoso - It specializes in elephants - Call for donations to be given at our website
   ```

1. Observe the output. This time, you'll likely see the format of an email with the specific animals included, as well as the call for donations.

1. Next, enter the following prompts that additionally specify the content:

   **System message:**
   
   ```
   You are an AI assistant helping to write emails
   ```

   **User message:**

   ```
   Write a promotional email for a new wildlife rescue, including the following: - Rescue name is Contoso - It specializes in elephants, as well as zebras and giraffes - Call for donations to be given at our website - Include a list of the current animals we have at our rescue after the signature, in the form of a table. These animals include elephants, zebras, gorillas, lizards, and jackrabbits.
   ```
   
1. Observe the output, and see how the email has changed based on your clear instructions.   

1. Next, enter the following prompts where we add details about tone to the system message:

   **System message:**
   
   ```
   You are an AI assistant that helps write promotional emails to generate interest in a new business. Your tone is light, chit-chat oriented, and you always include at least two jokes.
   ```

   **User message:**

   ```
   Write a promotional email for a new wildlife rescue, including the following: - Rescue name is Contoso - It specializes in elephants, as well as zebras and giraffes - Call for donations to be given at our website - Include a list of the current animals we have at our rescue after the signature, in the form of a table. These animals include elephants, zebras, gorillas, lizards, and jackrabbits..
   ```

1. Observe the output. This time, you'll likely see the email in a similar format, but with a much more informal tone. You'll likely even see jokes included!

1. Close the Cloudshell.
